### sidebar.hideName

A Boolean which is whether you'd like to hide the website name next to the icon.

### sidebar.borderRadius

A Boolean which is whether you'd like to set the border radius of the icon.

If you wish to set the border radius of the icon, you can do so by setting this to the size instead of a Boolean.

});
```

If you want to disable the border radius, you can do so by setting this to false.

```js

  icons: {
    sidebar: {
      borderRadius: false,
    },
  },
});
```

### sidebar.alignCenter
